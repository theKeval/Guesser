# NumbCrunch

NumbCrunch is an Android number-deduction game in active redevelopment. The
repository now contains two independent applications:

| Application | Gradle module | Source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **NumbCrunch revamp** | `:numbcrunch` | `numbcrunch/` | Primary Compose app; home, playable game, interactive tutorial, rules guide, and about implemented |
| **Guesser V1** | `:guesser_v1` | `app/` | Preserved, fully playable legacy game |

The revamp does not reuse V1 source or resources. Both applications build
independently from the same Gradle project.

## Current Revamp

The new app uses the package and application ID `io.keval.apps.numbcrunch`;
debug builds install separately as `io.keval.apps.numbcrunch.debug`
("NumbCrunch Debug"). Its current implemented experience includes:

- a responsive, scrollable, portrait-first Jetpack Compose home screen;
- Compose-drawn, resolution-independent controls for Single Player and Double
  Player modes;
- a masked Double Player secret field with three-unique-digit validation;
- in-memory handoff of a valid friend secret to the Game destination;
- a playable Game screen with a custom keypad, scrollable guess board,
  uniformly gray digit tiles with a staggered flip reveal,
  V1-style `R`/`W`/`SMYLE`/`Winner` remarks,
  quit confirmation, win dialog, and a help button that opens Gameplay while
  preserving the round;
- animated navigation to Game, Tutorial, Gameplay, and About destinations;
- a shared wood-background scaffold, back control, and Compose theme;
- clean module boundaries for UI, domain contracts, data, and app assembly.

Tutorial is a three-step swipeable walkthrough with a separate practice keypad;
it appears on first launch and remains available from Home afterward.
Gameplay explains rules with scored tile examples, modes, controls, and tips.
Game-board color feedback is currently disabled to increase difficulty;
the original green/orange/gray feedback remains available in learning examples.
About presents NumbCrunch's family origin story, credits, installed version, and
a Privacy policy button that opens the full policy inside the game; nothing in
the app links out to a website. All three reuse the wooden game theme.
The new app does **not yet implement sound, vibration settings, profiles, or
scoreboards**.

## Game Rules

The established NumbCrunch rules, implemented in both applications, are:

- The secret and every guess contain exactly three distinct digits.
- `R` means a digit is correct and in the correct position.
- `W` means a digit occurs in the secret but in another position.
- `SMYLE` means the guess shares no digits with the secret.
- `Winner` means all three digits and positions match.
- Leading zeroes are valid because codes are represented as strings.

Example: secret `245` and guess `325` produce `1R, 1W`.

See [Gameplay and implementation status](docs/gameplay.md) for the complete
rules and a precise distinction between V1 behavior and revamp behavior.

## Architecture

```text
:numbcrunch (Compose application and navigation)
├── :gameplay (Home and destination UI)
│   ├── :core-ui (Compose theme)
│   └── :domain (repository contracts and use cases)
├── :data (in-memory repository implementations)
│   └── :domain
├── :domain
└── :core-ui

:guesser_v1 (independent legacy XML/View application)
```

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `:numbcrunch` | Application entry point, manual dependency container, and Compose navigation |
| `:gameplay` | Home state/UI and Game, Tutorial, Gameplay, and About destinations |
| `:domain` | Pure Kotlin repository contracts and use cases |
| `:data` | Repository implementations; currently app info and in-memory session data |
| `:core-ui` | Shared Material 3 color and typography foundation |
| `:guesser_v1` | Complete legacy game, physically retained in `app/` |

See the [architecture guide](docs/architecture.md) and
[implementation guide](docs/implementation.md) for the runtime flow.

## Technology

- Kotlin 2.2
- Android Gradle Plugin 9.0.1 and Gradle 9.1
- Java 17
- Compile/target SDK 36; minimum SDK 21
- Jetpack Compose and Navigation Compose for the revamp
- XML Views, Navigation Component, LiveData, and ViewModel for V1
- JUnit 4 tests

The current revamp has no backend, account system, analytics, or network
integration. Double Player secrets are held only in memory and are lost when
the application process ends.

## Build and Test

Prerequisites:

1. JDK 17
2. Android SDK 36
3. `ANDROID_HOME` configured, or `sdk.dir` set in an untracked
   `local.properties`

Build both applications and run their JVM tests:

```bash
./gradlew :numbcrunch:assembleDebug \
  :gameplay:testDebugUnitTest \
  :domain:test \
  :guesser_v1:assembleDebug \
  :guesser_v1:testDebugUnitTest
```

Build only the primary revamp:

```bash
./gradlew :numbcrunch:assembleDebug
```

Install and launch the revamp:

```bash
./gradlew :numbcrunch:installDebug
adb shell am start -n io.keval.apps.numbcrunch.debug/io.keval.apps.numbcrunch.MainActivity
```

Install and launch V1:

```bash
./gradlew :guesser_v1:installDebug
adb shell am start -n com.thekeval.guesser/.MainActivity
```

## Release

The app version lives in `version.properties` and is read by
`numbcrunch/build.gradle`. Signed Play bundles are built with:

```bash
./gradlew :numbcrunch:bundleRelease
```

Signing requires one-time setup outside the repository. See the
[release guide](docs/releasing.md) for versioning rules, signing, and the Play
Console process, and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for shipped versions.
