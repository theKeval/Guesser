# Revamp History and Roadmap

## Project Eras

### 2021: Original Prototype

The original application established the hidden-number game, App and Friend
modes, `R`/`W`/`SMYLE` scoring, XML navigation, and a RecyclerView guess log.
Most interaction and state logic lived in `GameFragment`, and the build used
Android 30-era plugins and dependencies.

### April 2026: Compatibility Pass

Commit `c6fc98b` updated the original project for modern Gradle and Android
tooling and removed obsolete build configuration.

### May 2026: V1 Gameplay and UX Modernization

Commit `5b7cecd` substantially improved the original application:

- extracted pure `GameRules`;
- centralized round state in `GameViewModel`;
- modernized the guess model and adapter;
- refreshed Material layouts, themes, copy, and navigation;
- added a custom keypad, sound, vibration, animation, and confetti;
- added feedback settings and focused rule tests.

This version remains in `app/` and is now registered as `:guesser_v1`.

### August 2026: Documentation Baseline

PR #2 added the first comprehensive gameplay, architecture, implementation,
development, and roadmap documentation. Those documents originally described
the V1 application as the repository's only app.

### August 2026: Separate Modular Compose Revamp

PR #3, merged as `9288a48`, changed the project boundary rather than
incrementally rewriting V1. It:

- preserved `app/` as the independent `:guesser_v1` application;
- introduced the new `:guesser` Compose application with application ID
  `io.keval.apps.guesser`;
- added `:gameplay`, `:domain`, `:data`, and `:core-ui`;
- implemented the Compose Home screen and player-mode selection;
- added masked, validated Double Player secret setup;
- handed friend secrets to Game through an in-memory repository and use cases;
- added animated navigation and shared secondary-screen scaffolding;
- preserved original design artwork separately from runtime drawables;
- added Home ViewModel and domain use-case tests;
- improved secret privacy, selector accessibility, validation consistency, and
  wood-background contrast during review;
- redesigned Home controls to be Compose-drawn and screen-size independent
  while retaining the background/title artwork.

## Current Baseline

The primary revamp now includes a playable game. Its Home screen, setup
handoff, and Game screen are implemented. Tutorial, Gameplay, and About now
provide resource-backed learning, rules, and project content in the game theme.

The repository therefore has two valid but different baselines:

| Concern | Revamp `:guesser` | V1 `:guesser_v1` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI toolkit | Jetpack Compose | XML Views |
| Architecture | Multi-module, contracts/use cases, manual container | Single app module, MVVM-style |
| Home/setup | Implemented | Implemented within game screen |
| Complete guessing loop | Implemented, including quit-and-reveal | Implemented |
| Rules/scoring engine | Implemented (`GuessRules`) | Implemented |
| Feedback/settings | Sounds, haptics, confetti, background music; music/sound-effect settings | Implemented |
| Session persistence | Round in `SavedStateHandle`; friend secret in memory; tutorial completion and audio settings in Preferences DataStore | Round in memory; feedback preferences persisted |
| Package | `io.keval.apps.guesser` | `com.thekeval.guesser` |

## Current Risks and Gaps

1. **Partial game domain.** `GuessRules` covers validation, generation, and
   scoring, but round status and player mode live in the Game ViewModel rather
   than in domain models.
2. **Session-only handoff.** A friend secret is lost on process death and has no
   explicit consume lifecycle.
3. **Learning interaction coverage.** Tutorial deductions, example scores,
   and first-run completion use cases have unit tests, but practice/navigation/
   accessibility still need automated Compose coverage.
4. **Limited test depth.** Home/Game ViewModels, rules, and use cases are
   covered, but Compose behavior, navigation, and repository lifetime have no
   tests.
5. **Parallel app maintenance.** Build and documentation changes must avoid
   accidentally coupling or confusing V1 with the revamp.
6. **No automated delivery pipeline.** CI, signing, release automation, and
   store publishing remain undocumented/unimplemented.

## Recommended Next Phases

These phases describe a technically coherent path, not committed product
scope.

### Phase 1: Establish the Revamp Game Domain (largely done)

- Done: `GuessRules` ports validation, generation, and structured scoring
  without importing V1, with tests for the full remark table.
- Remaining: model round status and player mode explicitly in `:domain`, and
  define when the friend secret is consumed or cleared.

### Phase 2: Implement the Compose Game Loop (largely done)

- Done: stateful `GameRoute` + stateless `GameScreen`, both modes, keypad,
  scrolling history, win dialog, quit confirmation, help with state
  preservation, and ViewModel tests.
- Done: quit-and-reveal, swipe-back, sound, haptics, and win confetti.
- Remaining: Compose UI tests.

### Phase 3: Finish Product Content and Settings

- Done: resource-backed Tutorial with optional interactive practice, Gameplay
  visual rules reference, and About with story, credits, version, and links.
- Done: Settings with persisted music and sound-effect toggles.
- Decide whether a vibration setting belongs in the revamp.
- Add further settings storage only after each setting's lifetime and migration
  behavior are defined.

### Phase 4: Expand Product Capabilities Deliberately

- Decide whether rounds should survive configuration, process death, or full
  restarts.
- Evaluate profiles, scoreboards, statistics, and Google Play Games against
  concrete product requirements.
- Add CI, versioning, release notes, signing, and store metadata.

## Revamp Guardrails

- Keep `:guesser_v1` independent; do not use the application module as a
  library.
- Preserve established rules unless a product decision intentionally changes
  them.
- Represent secrets as strings so leading zeroes remain valid.
- Keep domain decisions free of Compose and Android dependencies.
- Pass sensitive setup through typed state/repositories, not navigation route
  text or logs.
- Distinguish implemented behavior from intended behavior in code, UI copy,
  tests, and documentation.
